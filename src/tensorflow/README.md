I didn't write any of this code but I fixed and changed a bit of things to make it work with my classifiers

All the licences are written in the files
The licences are MIT and GPL so I'm fine with it

I found this code on Github in the offcial google repository for Audioset and 
another repository for the conversion of this model to make it work with the keras abstraction
