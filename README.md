# sound-encoding-neural-network

## Overview
This repository contains my code for my research project at Kent university for the year
2020

## Experiments
I created a lot of models and tried multiple kind of architecture, the result is 
a repository a bit messy but I wanted to keep everything I coded.
All conclusive results are in the jupyter notebooks at the root of the repository.
