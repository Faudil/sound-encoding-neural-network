Parsers
==

##Description
This folder contains all the scripts I created to parse and format all gathered data into a standard format.

##Dependencies
All the scripts have been written and tested with a python3.6+ interpreter on an arch-linux distribution.
To run it you first need to install all the dependencies specified in the requirements file.
Some of the files also need ffmpeg installed.
